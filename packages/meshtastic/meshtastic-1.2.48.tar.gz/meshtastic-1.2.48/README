A python client for using `Meshtastic <https://www.meshtastic.org>`__
devices. This small library (and example application) provides an easy
API for sending and receiving messages over mesh radios. It also
provides access to any of the operations/data available in the device
user interface or the Android application. Events are delivered using a
publish-subscribe model, and you can subscribe to only the message types
you are interested in.
