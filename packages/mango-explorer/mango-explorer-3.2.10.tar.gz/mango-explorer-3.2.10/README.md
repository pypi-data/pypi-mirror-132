## Introduction

`mango-explorer` provides Python code to interface with [Mango Markets](https://mango.markets), along with a functional [marketmaker]](docs/MarketmakingQuickstart.md).

Here's a brief but complete example of how to place and cancel an order. [This example is runnable in your browser](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/blockworks-foundation/mango-explorer-examples/HEAD?labpath=PlaceAndCancelOrders.ipynb)!

```
import decimal
import mango
import os
import time

# Load the wallet from the environment variable 'KEYPAIR'. (Other mechanisms are available.)
wallet = mango.Wallet(os.environ.get("KEYPAIR"))

# Create a 'devnet' Context
context = mango.ContextBuilder.build(cluster_name="devnet")

# Load the wallet's account
group = mango.Group.load(context)
accounts = mango.Account.load_all_for_owner(context, wallet.address, group)
account = accounts[0]

# Load the market
stub = context.market_lookup.find_by_symbol("SOL-PERP")
market = mango.ensure_market_loaded(context, stub)

market_operations = mango.create_market_operations(context, wallet, account, market, dry_run=False)

print("Orders (initial):")
for order in market_operations.load_orders():
    print(order)

# Go on - try to buy 1 SOL for $10.
order = mango.Order.from_basic_info(side=mango.Side.BUY,
                                    price=decimal.Decimal(10),
                                    quantity=decimal.Decimal(1),
                                    order_type=mango.OrderType.POST_ONLY)
placed_order = market_operations.place_order(order)
print("\n\nplaced_order\n\t", placed_order)

print("\n\nSleeping for 10 seconds...")
time.sleep(10)

print("\n\nOrders (including our new order):")
for order in market_operations.load_orders():
    print(order)

cancellaton_signatures = market_operations.cancel_order(placed_order)
print("\n\ncancellaton_signatures:\n\t", cancellaton_signatures)

print("\n\nSleeping for 10 seconds...")
time.sleep(10)

print("\n\nOrders (without our order):")
for order in market_operations.load_orders():
    print(order)

```

Many more examples are provided in a separate [Github repo](https://github.com/blockworks-foundation/mango-explorer-examples) and can be [run in your browser (no installation required!) at Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/blockworks-foundation/mango-explorer-examples/HEAD).


## Running the marketmaker

There is a [Marketmaking Quickstart](docs/MarketmakingQuickstart.md) - a walkthrough of setting up and running the marketmaker on devnet, from setting up the account, depositing tokens, to running the marketmaker itself.

It can take around 30 minutes to run through.

Requirements:
* A server with docker installed

**Note** This walkthrough is devnet-only so no actual funds are used or at-risk.
