    """
    Employs HTTP requests to grab relevant entries from the On-Line Encyclopedia
    of Integer Sequences.

    Parameters
    ----------
    int_seq : list[int]
        the sequence of integers you want to query

    Example Usage
    -------------
    Retrieve the OEIS entry for a sequence beginning with {1, 2, 3}:

            one-beat and two-beat notes. The number of such rhythms having n
            beats altogether is F_{n+1}; therefore both Gopāla (before 1135) and
            Hemachandra (c. 1150) mentioned the numbers 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21,
