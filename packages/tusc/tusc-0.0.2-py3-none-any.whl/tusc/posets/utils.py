def parse_coverage_list(coverage_list):
    """
    Given a coverage_list (structured as a list of coverage statements (which
    are strings) that define the poset, parses them into a dictionary.

    Parameters
    ----------
    coverage_list : `list`
        list of coverage statements defining a poset, e.g.:
            ["_<1",
            "_<2",
            "_<3",
            "1<12",
            "1<13",
            "2<12",
            "2<23",
            "3<13",
            "3<23",
            "13<123",
            "12<123",
            "23<123"]

    Returns
    -------
    coverage_dict : `dict`
        keys are items in the poset, other than the maximal element
        values are items in the poset that cover their respective key
