Description: # ISRpy
        
        Utility and application modules for ISR (and CSR) data processing and modeling
        
        where:
        
            ISR=Incoherent Scatter Radar
            CSR=smaller ionospheric/atmospheric radars than ISR's that can only detect
        stronger coherent scatter than minimal level ionospheric incoherent scatter
        
        
        Try "ISRpy. TAB" in ipython for module methods and submodules...
        
        -readpack and beampack provides data read and target positioning
        routines for a collection of ISR's and CSR's.
        
        -pyigrf is a packet for geomagnetic vector field computataions based on the
        IGRF model.
        
        -kmltools provides routines for placing radar beam and data maps in Google Earth.
        
        -enoise is spectral noise level estimator based on Hildebrand-Sekhon algorithm.
