# Shyna System Information Package

Shyna system info package to fetch all system information

****Suggested: NOT TO USE****

This will be a small package for the shyna back-end process package. This will help to understand which OS and which system architect we are using. The package is still underdevelopment and new features will be added as Shyna's needs increases.

Following dependencies:

* psutil
* setuptools
* wheel
* urllib3
* tabulate
* GPUtil

```
from Shynasysinfo import Shsysinfo

cpu_info = Shsysinfo.CPUInfo()
print(cpu_info.get_cpu_details()) # Returns a dictionary

online_status = Shsysinfo.CheckOnline() 
print(online_status.test_connection()) # Returns True or False

disk_info = Shsysinfo.DiskInfo() 
print(disk_info.get_disk_info()) # Returns a dictionary

mem_info = Shsysinfo.MemoryInfo() 
print(mem_info.get_memory_info()) # Returns a dictionary

boot_info = BootTime()
print(boot_info.get_boot_time()) # Returns a dictionary with below details:
 #{'year': 2020, 'month': 8, 'day': 20, 'hour': 21, 'minute': 26, 'second': 29}
