class Ttest:
    r"""Computes the univariate :math:`t`-test at arbitrary order :math:`d`
    between two sets :math:`i` of traces. Informally, it allows to highlight a
    difference in statistical moments of order :math:`d` between the two sets.
    The metric is defined with:

    .. math::
        t = \frac{x_0 - x_1}{\sqrt{(v_0/n_0)+(v_1/n_1)}}

    where the both :math:`x_i` and :math:`v_i` are defined independently for
    each of the two sets and :math:`n_i` the number of available samples in the
    set :math:`i`.

    The expressions of :math:`x_i` and :math:`v_i` depend on the order `d` and relies on
    estimation of central and standardized moments. See [1]_ for full details.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ns : int
        Number of samples in a single trace.
    d : int
        Maximal statistical order of the :math:`t`-test.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from scalib.metrics import Ttest
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> traces = np.random.randint(0,256,(100,200),dtype=np.int16)
    >>> X = np.random.randint(0,2,100,dtype=np.uint16)
    >>> ttest = Ttest(200,d=3)
    >>> ttest.fit_u(traces,X)
    >>> t = ttest.get_ttest()

    Notes
    -----
    **Warning**: Ttest should not be used alone as a standalone evaluation tool
    because of its qualitative nature. See [2]_ and [3]_ for cautionary notes.
