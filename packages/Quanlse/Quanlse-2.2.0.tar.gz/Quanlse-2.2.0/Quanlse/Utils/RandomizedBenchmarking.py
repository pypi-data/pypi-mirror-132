"""
There are generally two ways in experiments for characterizing the performance of a quantum
computer in a superconducting platform: Quantum Process Tomography(QPT) and Randomized Benchmarking (RB)
. QPT can completely characterize a gate, decomposing a process into Pauli or Kraus operators,
but improving gates by QPT is complicated and resource-consuming. Also, State Preparation And Measurement
(SPAM) errors can be confused with process errors. However, RB is a concept of using randomization
methods for benchmarking quantum gates. It is a scalable and SPAM robust method for benchmarking the
full set of gates by a single parameter using randomization techniques. So it is useful to use RB for
a relatively simple and at least SPAM-robust benchmark, especially when the number of qubit increases.
