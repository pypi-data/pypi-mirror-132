"""
Simulating the time evolution of the qubits at the pulse level gives us more insight into how
quantum gates operates and the effects of noise. For superconducting quantum circuit, the
transmon qubits are controlled by applying microwave and magnetic flux. However, the performance
of quantum gates are often suppressed by various factors - the decoherence of the qubit due
to its interaction with the environment, the unwanted cross-talk effect and leakage into the
higher levels of the transmon.

The pulse-level simulator provided by Quanlse allows us to simulate quantum operations on
noisy quantum device consisting of multiple transmon qubits to better understand the physics
behind quantum computing.
