Quanlse's Scheduler Superconduct achieves the following goals:

- It generates parameters and AWG input signal arrays for fidelity-optimized pulses
  when leakage into the state :math:`|2\rangle` is taken into account.

- It is also capable of scheduling pulses to minimize idle time and therefore reduce
  decoherence losses.

- At the same time, it allows for the visualization of pulse sequences for the users
  to check the results.

CNOT gate is rarely directly implemented on superconducting quantum chips. Instead,
it is often constructed by piecing together single-qubit gates and other two-qubit
gates like CR gate or ISWAP gate that can be easily implemented on a superconducting
chip (often called native gates). The two-qubit gates that are available in the
transmon-like superconducting qubit architecture can be divided into two categories:

**Flux-controlled**

This class of gates offers the advantage of short gate time to minimize decoherence
error. However, tuning the qubit frequency can introduce flux noises and lead to the
problem of frequency crowding.

**All-microwave control**

CR gate allows for an all-microwave control, which alleviates the problem of flux
noise. However, the much longer time-scale limits the gate fidelity (because of
the decoherence effects of qubits).

Since CZ gates can be used to construct a CNOT gate easily by using only two other
single-qubit gates, Quanlse's Scheduler offers this way to construct a CNOT gate
in a quantum circuit.
