[Quanlse (量脉)](https://quanlse.baidu.com) is a cloud-based platform for quantum control developed by the [Institute for Quantum Computing](https://quantum.baidu.com) at Baidu Research. Quanlse aims to bridge the gap between quantum software and hardware. It provides efficient and professional quantum control solutions via an open-source SDK strengthened by Quanlse Cloud Service.

Quanlse supports the pulse generation and scheduling of arbitrary single-qubit and two-qubit gates. With the help of toolkits in Quanlse, one can use Quanlse for modeling real superconducting quantum chips, simulating noisy quantum devices and dynamical evolution, visualizing error analysis, and characterizing and mitigating error. Single/two-qubit gates and general Mølmer-Sørensen gate realization on the trapped ion platform and relevant applications on the NMR platform are also available in Quanlse. For the practicality in experiments, Quanlse provides the toolkit for qubit and readout cavity calibration. Furthermore, Quanlse supports pulse-level control of quantum algorithms and advanced R&D (Research & Development) in the field of quantum control.



## Quanlse v2.2

**Attention: We have added some exciting features and further improved the original ones in Quanlse v2.2. We strongly recommend users to upgrade to Quanlse v2.2!**

![](https://release-data.bd.bcebos.com/Quanlse_architecture_en.png)

In this update, we provide `Lab` package to support the superconducting quantum computing experiment, as well as the interface for experiment parameter service and hardware access. At the same time, we improved the fundamental modules to support the flexible defining of control pulses and control channels. In trapped ion, we provide a robust quantum laser pulse control solution, and provide some fundamental modules for quantum laser, ion chip and ion-phonon evolution trajectory to reveal the noise influence on trapped ion system. 

## Install

We strongly recommend using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) for your R&D environment and upgrading the requirements to the latest versions for the best experience.

### Install via pip

We recommend the following way of installing Quanlse with `pip`

```bash
pip install Quanlse
```

### Update

If you have already installed Quanlse, use the following code to update

```
pip install --upgrade Quanlse
```

### Download and install via GitHub

You can also download all the files and install Quanlse locally

```bash
git clone http://github.com/baidu/Quanlse
cd Quanlse
pip install -e .
```

### Run programs

Now, you can try to run a program to verify whether Quanlse has been installed successfully

```bash
cd Example
python 1-example-pi-pulse.py
```

## Introduction and developments

### Overview

To get started with Quanlse, users are recommended to go through the [Overview](https://quanlse.baidu.com/#/doc/overview) firstly to acquire the whole picture of this platform. [Quick Start](https://quanlse.baidu.com/#/doc/quickstart) could then be a good place to guide you on how to use Quanlse Cloud Service step by step and how to construct your first program using Quanlse. Next, users are encouraged to learn more functions and applications from the [tutorials](https://quanlse.baidu.com/#/doc/tutorial-construct-ham) Quanlse provided. Finally, it would be great if users could solve their own problems using Quanlse. For complete and detailed documentation of the Quanlse API, please refer to our [API documentation](https://quanlse.baidu.com/api/).
