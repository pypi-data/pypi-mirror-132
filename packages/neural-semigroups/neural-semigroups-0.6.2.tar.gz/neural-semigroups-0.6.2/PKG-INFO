# Neural Semigroups

Here we try to model Cayley tables of semigroups using neural networks.

This work was inspired by [a sudoku
solver](https://github.com/Kyubyong/sudoku). A solved Sudoku puzzle
is nothing more than a Cayley table of a quasigroup from 9 items with
some well-known additional properties. So, one can imagine a puzzle
made from a Cayley table of any other magma, e.g. a semigroup, by
hiding part of its cells.

There are two major differences between sudoku and puzzles based on
semigroups:

1) it's easy to take a glance on a table to understand whether it is
a sudoku or not. That's why it was possible to encode numbers in a
table cells as colour intensities. Sudoku is a picture, and a
semigroup is not. It's difficult to check a Cayley table's
associativity with a naked eye;

2) Sudoku puzzles are solved by humans for fun and thus catalogued.
When solving a sudoku one knows for sure that there is a unique
solution. On the contrary, nobody guesses values in a partially
filled Cayley table of a semigroup as a form of amusement. As a
result, one can create a puzzle from a full Cayley table of a
semigroup but there may be many distinct solutions.

# How to Install

The best way to install this package is to use `pip`:

```sh
pip install neural-semigroups
```

# How to use

The simplest way to get started is to [use Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/github/inpefess/neural-semigroups/blob/master/examples/dae_4_colab.ipynb).

To look at more experimental results for different semigroups cardinalities, you can use [Kaggle](https://kaggle.com):

* [cardinality 4](https://www.kaggle.com/inpefess/neural-semigroups-dae-dim-4)
* [cardinality 5](https://www.kaggle.com/inpefess/neural-semigroups-dae-dim-5)

There is also an experimental [notebook](https://github.com/inpefess/neural-semigroups/blob/master/examples/ExperimentNotebook.ipynb) contributed by [Žarko Bulić](https://github.com/zarebulic).

# How to Contribute

[Pull requests](https://github.com/inpefess/neural-semigroups/pulls) are welcome. To start:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/inpefess/neural-semigroups
cd neural-semigroups
# activate python virtual environment with Python 3.6+
pip install -U pip
pip install -U setuptools wheel poetry
poetry install
# recommended but not necessary
pre-commit install
```

To check the code quality before creating a pull request, one might run the script [show_report.sh](https://colab.research.google.com/github/inpefess/neural-semigroups/blob/master/show_report.sh). It locally does nearly the same as the CI pipeline after the PR is created.

# Reporting issues or problems with the software

Questions and bug reports are welcome on [the tracker](https://github.com/inpefess/neural-semigroups/issues). 

# More documentation

More documentation can be found [here](https://neural-semigroups.readthedocs.io/en/latest).

# The paper

There is also a [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.07388) with more maths inside. It can be used to [cite](https://dblp.org/rec/journals/corr/abs-2103-07388.html?view=bibtex) the package.
