# formbox

This tiny script formats an [mbox] as HTML or XML.  It is intended
for rendering email replies on websites and their [RSS] feed.

## Prerequisites

This Python package depends on [bleach] for HTML sanitising
and [markdown] for, well, rendering Markdown to HTML.  It is, however,
not designed to work with HTML emails with all those CSS and Java scripts.
