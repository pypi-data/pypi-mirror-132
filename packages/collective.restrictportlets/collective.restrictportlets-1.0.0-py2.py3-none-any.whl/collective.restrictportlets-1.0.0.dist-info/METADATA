===========================
collective.restrictportlets
===========================

This packages allows you to restrict the available portlets that non-Managers can add.

Features
--------

- On any page where portlets can be added, the product checks a list of portlets that are restricted to only Managers.
  This includes the personal dashboard.

- There is a control panel for selecting which portlets to disallow for non-Managers.

Compatibility
-------------

This package is tested on Plone 4.3 and 5.0.

It should be fine for Plone 4.1 and 4.2 as well:

- It patches a method from ``plone.portlets`` that has not changed since version 2.0 (Plone 4.0).

- We need ``plone.app.registry`` for our setting and the control panel, so this means Plone 4.1.

The most important part of this package is a small `monkey patch <https://github.com/collective/collective.restrictportlets/blob/master/src/collective/restrictportlets/patches.py>`_ for ``plone.portlets.manager.PortletManager.getAddablePortletTypes``.
If you have other code that patches this, it may not work.


Testing
-------

This package is tested with Travis:

    :target: http://travis-ci.org/collective/collective.restrictportlets


Default
-------

After you install the product in the Plone add-ons control panel, by default these portlets are restricted:

- Classic portlet

- Login portlet

You can make them available again in the *Restrict portlets* control panel.


Translations
------------

This product has been translated into:

- Dutch (Maurits van Rees)


Installation
------------

Install collective.restrictportlets by adding it to your buildout::

    [buildout]

    ...

    eggs =
        collective.restrictportlets


and then running ``bin/buildout``.
Now you can activate it in the add-ons control panel and configure it in the *Restrict portlets* control panel.
