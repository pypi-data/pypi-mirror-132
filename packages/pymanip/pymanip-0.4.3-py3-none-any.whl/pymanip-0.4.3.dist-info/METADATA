pymanip
=======

Description and goals
---------------------

pymanip is the main package that we use for data acquisition and
monitoring of our experimental systems in the Convection group at
`Laboratoire de physique de l’ENS de
Lyon <http://www.ens-lyon.fr/PHYSIQUE>`__. It can be seen as an
extension of the
`FluidLab <https://foss.heptapod.net/fluiddyn/fluidlab>`__ module, which
it heavily uses. It is available freely under the French `CECILL-B
license <https://cecill.info/licences/Licence_CeCILL-B_V1-en.html>`__ in
the hope that it can be useful to others. But it is provided AS IS,
without any warranty as to its commercial value, its secured, safe,
innovative or relevant nature.

Unlike FluidLab, pymanip does not garantee any long term stability, and
may change the API in the future without warning. However, some parts of
the pymanip module may eventually be integrated into FluidLab, once they
are stable enough.

The pymanip module is a set of tools for data acquisition and data
management. Its goals are the following:

-  management of experimental “sessions”, for storing and retriving
   data, and useful live tools for experimental monitoring over long
   times, such as live plot, automated emails, and remote access of the
   live data, and also simple interrupt signal management;
-  simplify access to FluidLab instrument classes;
-  experimental implementation of asynchroneous video acquisition and
   DAQ acquisition;
-  experimental extension of FluidLab interface and instrument classes
   with asynchroneous methods;
-  miscellaneous CLI tools for saved session introspection, live video
   preview, live oscilloscope and spectrum analyser-style DAQ preview,
   and VISA/GPIB scanning.
