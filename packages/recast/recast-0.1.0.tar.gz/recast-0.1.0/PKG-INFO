# recast
python bit recaster

Convenient functions for converting bytes into various different python
types. These functions do not modify the underlying bits, but rather,
how they are interpreted in python.

## Examples
```py
>>> import recast

>>> hex(recast.int2uint(-1))
'0xffffffff'

>>> recast.double2bytes(4.400150012111731e-110)
b'recast:)'
```
