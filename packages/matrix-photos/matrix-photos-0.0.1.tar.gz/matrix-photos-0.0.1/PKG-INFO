Description: # matrix-photos
        This aims to be a simple [matrix](https://matrix.org/) client for the photOS DIY photoframe.
        
        Matrix is an open standard for secure, decentralised, real-time communication.
        
        For photOS please checkout https://github.com/avanc/photOS for more information.
        
        This client can be used to transfer files (pictures/photos) to the photoframe with end to end encryption support.
        The idea is, that trusted users just can create a matrix room and invite the photoframe matrix user.
        The photoframe user will automatically join this room and download all pictures send to this room.
        
        ## Configuration
        
        There is a config-example.yml in this projects which should be mostly self-explaining.
        
        It is possible to add textmessages to the images. This is done with the tool 'convert'.
        The client automatically adds the first message after you post media content to the latest image when write_text_messages is set to true.
        
        You can also define optionally define an admin_user which can run some administration commands on the photoframe.
        If you define an admin user then just send !help from the specified user to the chatroom and the client sends you a list of available commands.
        
        ## Running
        
        Just create a virtual environement install the requirements and you can run the client.
        
        ```
            python -m matrix_photos -c /path/to/config.yml
        ```
        
        ## Development
        
        If you want to develop or test the client, there is a docker-compose file in the docker directory which starts a matrix synapse homeserver,
        a postgres database, an element matrix client and pgadmin if you want to check the database.
