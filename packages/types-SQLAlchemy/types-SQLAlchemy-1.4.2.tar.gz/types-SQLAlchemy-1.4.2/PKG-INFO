## Typing stubs for SQLAlchemy

This is a PEP 561 type stub package for the `SQLAlchemy` package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like mypy, PyCharm, pytype etc. to check code
that uses `SQLAlchemy`. The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/master/stubs/SQLAlchemy. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

The `sqlalchemy-stubs` package is an alternative to this package and also includes a mypy plugin for more precise types.

See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/master/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `40f2cb6e39c4ad7df52f19d8e4f148c55c54a250`.
