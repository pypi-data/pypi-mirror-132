"""
## This is an example FDTD simulation. It contains structures in different shapes and materials. Wave is incident by point sources and a Total-field scattered-field (TF/SF) source. CPML boundaries to absorb the scattered waves.

## What you do: run this file. A figure window is shown, which contains a simple graphical user-interface (GUI):

* Click "play/pause" to start simulation. Click again to pause it.
* Click "step" to run simulation by one time step.
* Click "Render" to show the field in a smoothly rendered plot.
* Click "Reset" to clear everything and start over.
* The Axes plots a rectangular solving space.
  * The gray region at the edge is the CPML.
  * The large purple rectangle marks the TF/SF source boundary.
  * There are several structures in the solving space. Different colors mark different materials.
* Near the top of the figure window are controls for video recording
  * Click "Record" to start recording, click it again to stop recording and write to file.
  * Click "Pause" to pause recording. Then you can still run simulation without recording it.
  * FPS and DPI can be changed
  * You can input your choice of file name for the video.
* Simulation time-steps are displayed.

## The structure of a simulation script:
1. Initialize the solver, choose parameters such as polarization, time step length, solving mode, and total time steps.
2. Add structures to the solving space
3. Setup sources
4. Setup PML if needed
5. Setup monitors if needed
6. Run the file. The GUI is shown.
A detailed example of each part is found in this script.

## Units:
All simulations run in natural units, i.e. permittivity, permeability and light speed are 1.
