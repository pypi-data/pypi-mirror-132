attachtags is a tool for recording and categorizing files in your Windows. Use it to help you organize and categorize files that are difficult to remember.

.. _header-n3:

Introduction
-------------

Have we all had this idea, wanting to figure out what files are in our computer? But various file formats and messy file names always give us headaches. After figuring out what these files were doing in various ways, a few days later, I forgot it again.

Or this situation: when we delete a software, there will always be some unknown files left in the computer. I want to clean the computer and delete useless files, but I don't know which are important files and which can be deleted.

attachtags is a command line script tool made to solve this problem. By adding a memorable label to a file or folder, the purpose of recording and classifying files is achieved.
