Open metrics exporter for NETGEAR switches of the Smart Managed Plus series to provide data to databases such as [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io) or [InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/).

## What is the purpose?
NETGEAR switches of the [Smart Managed Plus series](https://www.netgear.de/business/products/switches/web-managed/) do not provide a standards conform interface for providing statistics of traffic and other information. There is no support for monitoring protocols such as [SNMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Network_Management_Protocol). Still these switches are deployed in large numbers in professional and private environments where monitoring of the switches is highly desired. A common solution for monitoring is to store the data in a [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io) database and visualize and alert with tools such as [Grafana](https://grafana.com/). prosafe_exporter_python provides a tool that colelcts the data from the switches webinterface and provides it using the [OpenMetrics format](https://openmetrics.io/) that can be directly used in [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#scrape_config) or [Influx scrape jobs](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v2.0/write-data/no-code/scrape-data/manage-scrapers/create-a-scraper/).


## Exported Metrics

| metric                       | description                                    | labels                                   |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| prosafe_switch_info          | Information about the switch exposed as labels | hostname, product_name, switch_name, serial_number, mac_adresse, bootloader_version, firmware_version, dhcp_mode, ip_adresse, subnetmask, gateway_adresse |
| prosafe_receive_bytes_total  | Incoming transfer in bytes                     | hostname, port                           |
| prosafe_transmit_bytes_total | Outgoing transfer in bytes                     | hostname, port                           |
| prosafe_error_packets_total  | Transfer error in packets                      | hostname, port                           |
| prosafe_link_speed           | Link speed in Mbps                             | hostname, port                           |
| prosafe_max_mtu*             | Maximum MTU                                    | hostname, port                           |

\* not available in all firmware versions

## Usage
Setup a config.yml
```yml
global: 
  retrieve_interval: 20.0
  retries: 10
  host: "0.0.0.0"
  port: 9493
switches: 
  - hostname: "192.168.0.100"
    password: "password123"
  - hostname: "192.168.0.200"
    password: "password123"
```
Run with:
```bash
prosafe_exporter path/to/your/config.yml
```
In prometheus configure a scrape job, e.g. like this:
```yml
scrape_configs:
 - job_name: 'prosafe_switches'
    static_configs:
      - targets:
        - "prosafe_exporter:9493"
    metrics_path: /probe
    scrape_interval: 60s
```
In InfluxDB configure a scrape job like this: [Influx scrape configuration](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v2.0/write-data/no-code/scrape-data/manage-scrapers/create-a-scraper/)

## Docker
prosafe_exporter is also available as a stand-alone docker container from [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/tillsteinbach/prosafe_exporter_python)

## Query Example for Grafana
Outgoing data rate of port `1` on `192.168.0.123` is below.
```
rate(prosafe_transmit_bytes_total{instance="192.168.0.123", port="1"}[1m])
```
### Grafana Screenshot
This is how the data could look like in Grafana with an [example configuration](https://github.com/tillsteinbach/prosafe_exporter_python/blob/master/examples/grafana/dashboard_example.json):

## Tested Switches
The following Switches are continously tested with real hardware:
- GS108Ev3
- GS108PEv3

Other Devices can be regression tested with prerecorded datasets. If you want to contribute with data from a switch not listed, please contact me or open an [issue](https://github.com/tillsteinbach/prosafe_exporter_python/issues).

## Tested Firmware
- V2.06.14GR
- V2.06.14EN
-	V2.06.03EN

If you want to contribute with data from a switch not listed here, please contact me or open an [issue](https://github.com/tillsteinbach/prosafe_exporter_python/issues).

## Reporting Issues
Please feel free to open an issue at [GitHub Issue page](https://github.com/tillsteinbach/prosafe_exporter_python/issues) to report problems you found.

### Known Issues
- May not work with older firmware, not all firmware versions are tested
- Does not work with Japanese firmware
