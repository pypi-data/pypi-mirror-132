        ## About
        Command line application created in python with json and sqlite to easy store password. The stored data will be encrypted so only the person with master key will be able to access it.
        
        ## Modules
        cryptography - to encrypt data before saving in database
        ```
        pip install cryptography
        ```
        hashlib - to hash user password before storing in json file
        
        colorama, termcolor - for color
        ```
        pip install colorama
        pip install termcolor
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        ```
        fort
        > Login  # Already created account
        
          > insert        # insert into database
          > display       # display whole database
          > get           # get selected password and decrypt it
          > logout        # logout of current acount
          
        > Signup # Create new account
        > Erase  # Delete account!!!
        ```
        
        ## Development
        Still working on this project.<br>
        - The Erase functionality is currently not provided as it creates some issues, will add that in future.<br>
        - More functions like displaying * while typing password will be added after I finish some other projects.<br>
        - Next version will store everything in sqlite database instead of storing user details in json file.<br>
        - Copy Key option will be added to store key seperate as user want.
