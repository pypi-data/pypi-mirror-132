# Simple Flask CMS

Simple flask CMS aims to be a very simple and flexible CMS system, suitable for a wide range of uses. The modular design
allows you to use or not use various parts depending on use.

Right now, the plugin is still in development, however, it aims to support the following features:

Currently, working features

* Simple page editor using SimpleMarkdownEditor
* Ability to upload and manage images
* Automatically generate navigation menus
* Support for SQL
* Authentication

Currently, WIP features:

* Headless mode
* Support for MongoDB
* More content types: Fragments and posts

Now it uses SQL and mongoDB support was temporarily dropped, though it will be added again soon.

## Installing

Install via pip:

```bash
pip install simple_flask_cms
```

And use in your application:

```python
import simple_flask_cms

app.register_blueprint(simple_flask_cms.cms)
```

You can set some settings:

```python
import simple_flask_cms.database_providers.sql_database

simple_flask_cms.config.db_connection = simple_flask_cms.database_providers.sql_database.SQLDatabaseProvider(
    app)  # The database to use
# You can get a free mongoDB database from atlas, or use your own database. SQL support coming soon.
simple_flask_cms.config.template_name = 'page.html'  # The template to use for CMS pages, later section explains in more detail.
simple_flask_cms.config.upload_folder = 'media/images'  # Where to place uploaded images
simple_flask_cms.config.authentication_function = simple_flask_cms.noop_authentication_function  # Used to authenticate requests
```

Simple-Flask-CMS will attempt to connect to the database before the first request.

## Creating a page template

If you want to use Simple-Flask-CMS for pages, you need to provide a page template. An example of a template would look
like this:

```jinja
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>{{ page.title }}
</head>
<body>
<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
<article>
     {{ page.html | safe }}
</article>
<nav>
    {% include 'recursive_nav.html' %}
</nav>
```

The file `recursive_nav.html`:

```jinja
<ul>
    {% for page in nav %}
        <li><a href="{{ page.get_absolute_url() }}">{{ page.nav_title }}</a></li>
        {% if page.subpages %}
            {% with nav=page.subpages %}
                {% include 'recursive_nav.html' %}
            {% endwith %}
        {% endif %}
    {% endfor %}
</ul>
```

In the aim for minimalism, Simple Flask CMS gives you full control over the styling of your pages. However, if you want
a preset look take a look at the example in the repository.

## Creating your first page

To create a page, navigate to `/cms/editor/[your new page path]`. Enter your settings for the page here. The page will
be shown under `/cms/[page path]`. In the navigation `/cms/bugs/ladybuy` will appear under `/cms/bug`.

### Title

Typically displayed at the top of the page, though you can customize this in your template.

### Navigation title

Typically shown in the nav bar and in links to the page. Defaults to be the same as the title.

### Page content

The page content is markdown, using the [python-markdown](python-markdown.github.io) package. By default the code blocks
and highlight extension are enabled.

### Sort order

The order that the page will be shown in under navigation. Defaults to the number of pages. 0 means auto.

## Adding Authentication

By default, anybody can create or delete pages. Typically, this is not what you want. Flask-Simple-CMS does not include
it's own authentication function, but rather you can supply your own.

The typical way is to assign a function to `cms.authentication_function`. This function should return `None` if the
request is authorized. If it returns anything else, the returned value will be sent as a response back to the client
instead of the action. An example of a authentication function using only basic auth is:

```python
def authentication_function(action, parameters):
    if action in simple_flask_cms.config.viewer_paths:
        return None  # Anonymous users can view but not edit pages

    auth = flask.request.authorization
    if auth and auth.username == config["username"] and auth["password"] == config["password"]:
        return None
    else:
        return flask.Response(
            status=401,
            headers={'WWW-Authenticate': 'Basic realm="FlaskCMS"'}
        )
```

Then set it like:

```python
cms.authentication_function = authentication_function
```

In this case, `action` is the name of the endpoint, and parameters are the path parameters. For example, if you wanted
to hide a specific path from the viewer without authentication, replace the first if statement with this:

```python
if action in simple_flask_cms.config.viewer_paths and not parameters["path"].startswith("secret"):
    return None
```

## Use in headless mode

To use in headless mode, you can send a request from your frontend to `/cms/<page>` with the
header `Content-Type: Application/JSON`. An example looks like this:

```json
{
  "page": {
    "path": "home",
    "title": "Home",
    "nav_title": "Home",
    "sort_order": 0,
    "date_modified": "2021-09-23T14:34:05.929918",
    "subpages": [],
    "content": "Home\n\n![image.jpg](/cms/images/image.jpg)",
    "html": "<p>Home</p>\n<p><img alt=\"image.jpg\" src=\"/cms/images/image.jpg\"></p>"
  },
  "nav": [
    {
      "path": "home",
      "title": "Home",
      "nav_title": "Home",
      "sort_order": 0,
      "date_modified": "2021-09-23T14:34:05.929918",
      "subpages": []
    }
  ]
}
```

The response will contain both the raw markdown and the generated HTML by default. Usually, you want either one. You can
configure this behavior with either of these headers:

```text
X-IncludeMarkdown: false
X-IncludeHTML: false
```

# Fragments

A fragment is a type of content intended for being embeded on another page. You would typically use a fragment if you
want a small part of a page to be editable via the CMS but also need some advanced interactions or layout on the page
that the CMS can't handle.

To use fragments, assign a value to `simple_flask_cms.config.fragments`. For example, if you want the home page to have
seperate boxes for the left and right column, you might do this:

```python
simple_flask_cms.config.fragments_map = [
    simple_flask_cms.dataclasses.FragmentType(
        name="Home Column 1",
        description="Displayed in the left column in the home page",
        url="/"
    ),
    simple_flask_cms.dataclasses.FragmentType(
        name="Home Column 2",
        description="Displayed in the right column in the home page",
        url="/"
    )
]
```

Here, `name` is the unique identifier of the fragment. Must contain only url-safe characters.

`description` is displayed at the top of the fragment editor. You can describe where the fragment is used in more detail
here.

Optionally, you can specify a `url` which is where the "visit this page" button will lead to.

You can then use it in your template like this:

```jinja
<div>
    {{ cms_fragment('Home Column 1') | safe }}
    <a href="{{ url_for('simple_flask_cms.fragment', name='Home Column 1')}}">
        Edit this fragment
    </a>
</div>
```

You probably want to selectively show the editor button depending on a users permissions. or not show it at all.

# Custom context vars

You can add custom context variables for use in your page template by assigning to the
`config.extra_page_config_provider`. This function takes the path as a paramter and should return a dict which will be
passed to the page template.

# Extra Custom Pages in nav

Often you might want to include other pages, not provided by the CMS visible in the navigation section too. You provide
a list of such pages in `config.extra_nav_urls`. `nav_title` and `sort_order` work similar to normal pages, but
the `redirect` will replace the destination of the link in nav.

For example:

```python
simple_flask_cms.config.extra_nav_urls = [
    simple_flask_cms.dataclasses.ExtraNavUrl(
        nav_title="Color",
        path="/colors",
        redirect="/colors"
    )
]
```

You can also render navigation on a custom page using the `cms_nav` function, like this:
```jinja
{% with nav=cms_nav() %}
    {% for page in nav %}
        <!-- Put content here -->
    {% endfor %}
{% endwith %|
```
