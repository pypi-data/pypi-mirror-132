                      Modified matcher.m to to the following things:
		        - Include the 1 loop corrections to SM parameters in the EoM for the redundancies
		        - Use WCxf style notation for the Wilson coefficients in Warsaw basis.
		        - Added function PrettyShow[x] to matcher.m to show the WC in Warsaw basis in nice (not-text) format
21/06/2019 ACarmona. Solved problem with "-" and input
18/06/2019 ACarmona. raw_input and input compatibility
12/06/2019 ACarmona. Added tab autocompletion for feynrules-path

12/06/2019 ACarmona. Fixed the problem with useSusyno.m 
05/06/2019 ACarmona. Now replacegaugedata can be copied from core
05/06/2019 ACarmona. Some changes in functions.py to allow for non _MM names in folders
28/05/2019 ACarmona. Copied the fr files of the BFM SM to core
28/05/2019 ACarmona. Modification of create_MM_model.wl so now it loads the fr files of the SM from core
28/05/2019 ACarmona. Modification of create_MM_model.wl so we can create models not in the current directory
28/05/2019 ACarmona. Modification of create_MM_model.wl so that now it replace the actual path of ferynrules
24/05/2019 ACarmona. Solved DEVNULL problem when working with python2.7 in functions.py
22/05/2019 JSantiago. Fixed a problem with repeated entries of the form alpha(f1,f2)=f(f1,f2), alpha(f2,f1)=f(f2,f1) from complex conjugation.
15/05/2019 JSantiago. Merged with new version after hints from Thomas Hahn

0.3.4.25:
08/05/2019 ACarmona. Added the python package future as a requirement 
08/05/2019 ACarmona. Updated UseSusyno.m to include the complex conjugate of a coupling
08/05/2019 ACarmona. Synchronized the development/UseSusyno.m with the one in core
29/03/2019 ACarmona. Fixed FR2MM.m to avoid Transpose error. 
29/03/2019 ACarmona. Eliminiated the extra spaces created in gaugetensorcoeffs.dat via FR2MM.m 
29/03/2019 ACarmona. Commented out GetGaugeData in matcher.m
29/03/2019 ACarmona. Changed matchmakerpath to REPLACEPATH in matcher.m
29/03/2019 ACarmona. Changed matcher.m and matcher.nb in development accordingly.
29/03/2019 ACarmona. Changed UseSusyno.m to include invariants.
29/03/2019 ACarmona. Added a quadruplet in UnbrokenSM_BFM_Particle_Content.fr
12/03/2019 JSantiago. matcher.m cleaned up.
12/03/2019 JSantiago/ACarmona. Modified matcher.m to allow for parallelization.
04/03/2019 JSantiago. Added skeleton_parallel.frm to core. Changed
libs/generate_form.py to use it instead of the original skeleton.frm 
27/02/2019 JSantiago. FR2MM.m modified to write files
particleirreps.dat and gaugetensorcoeffs.dat inside
model/QGRAF/model_data 
26/02/2019 JSantiago. Canonical Normalization now fully
implemented. TotalMatcher returns a list of dimension 3x2, including
the redundant but canonically normalized WC in the second position.
22/02/2019 JSantiago. Implemented the function CanonicallyNormalize in
matcher.m to apply canonical normalization in the redundant WC. Also
added canonicalnormalization.dat with all the relevant
renormalizations to matchmaker/core
12/02/2019 JSantiago. Eliminated the 'samb(x)' in the form skeleton
11/02/2019 JSantiago. Fixed a typo in useSusyno.m (needs matcher.m)
08/02/2019 JSantiago. Split matcher.m into matcher.m (that now checks if replacegaugedata is present and does not need susyno) and useSusyno.m (which uses susyno to re-create the file replacegaugedata)
08/02/2019 JSantiago. Changed MatchMaker.py to add the function clean_model

0.3.4.24: JSantiago. run_qgraf.py modified to write the tree-level two point functions only for EFT models
0.3.4.23: JSantiago. There was a problem with including only SM particles at tree level in UV models. This is fixed now and therefore we go back to define alphaSxx as before (if no correction they are automatically 0 because SM processes are not computed).
0.3.4.22: JSantiago. There were still problems with L4SM, should be fixed now
0.3.4.21: JSantiago. Fixed some problem with the installation of the new L2SM and L4SM
0.3.4.20: JSantiago. L2SM and L4SM are not addition to the SM so that the corresponding alphaSxx are zero in the absence of corrections
0.3.4.19: JSantiago. matcher.m adds SimpleShow. Also TotalMatcher now returns
                     a the following list {{tree redundant,1loop redundant},
		                           {tree warsaw, 1loop warsaw}}
0.3.4.18: JSantiago. download_models checks if directory already present 
0.3.4.17: JSantiago. Fixed some bugs with the installation.
0.3.4.16: JSantiago. Expanded manual
0.3.4.15: JSantiago. Add docs to distribution (manual.pdf and UpdateNotes.txt)
