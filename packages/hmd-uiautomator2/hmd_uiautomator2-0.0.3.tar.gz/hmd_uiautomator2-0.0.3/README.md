# Introduction 
Because uiautomator2 will automatically disconnect after being used in Android 12 for a long time, the test terminal will be disconnected. The root cause is that the old version of uiautomator apks is not compatible with Android 12. Therefore, I wrote uiautomator apks from, and using custom apks needs to modify uiautomator2, so I have this version

#Usage
Same as uiautomator2
