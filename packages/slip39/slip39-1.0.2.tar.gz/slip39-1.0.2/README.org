#+BEGIN_ABSTRACT
Creating Ethereum accounts is complex and fraught with potential for loss of funds.

Creating a BIP-39 seed recover phrase helps, but a *single* lapse in security dooms the account.  If
someone finds your recover phrase, the account is gone.

The SLIP-39 standard allows you to split the seed between 1 or more groups of multiple recovery
phrases.  This is better, but creating such accounts is difficult; presently, only the Trezor
supports these, and they can only be created "manually".  Writing down 5 or more sets of 20 words is
difficult and time consuming.

The [[https://github.com/pjkundert/=python-slip39.git][python-slip39]] project exists to assist in the safe creation and documentation of [[https://wolovim.medium.com/ethereum-201-hd-wallets-11d0c93c87][Ethereum HD
Wallet]] accounts, with various SLIP-39 sharing parameters.  It generates the new wallet seed,
generates standard Ethereum account(s) (at [[https://medium.com/myetherwallet/hd-wallets-and-derivation-paths-explained-865a643c7bf2][derivation path]] =m/66'/40'/0'/0/0= by default) with
Ethereum wallet address and QR code, produces the required SLIP-39 phrases, and outputs a single PDF
containing all the required printable cards to document the account.

On an secure (ideally air-gapped) computer, new accounts can safely be generated and the PDF saved
to a USB drive for printing (or directly printed without the file being saved to disk.)

* Security with Availability

  A 128-bit random "seed" is the source of an unlimited sequence of Ethereum HD Wallet accounts.
  Anyone who can obtain this seed gains control of all Ethereum accounts derived from it, so it must
  be securely stored.

  Losing this seed means that all of the HD Wallet accounts are permanently lost.  Therefore, it
  must be backed up reliably, and be readily accessible.

  Therefore, we must:

  - Ensure that nobody untrustworthy can recover the seed, but
  - Store the seed in many places with several (some perhaps untrustworthy) people.

  How can we address these conflicting requirements?

** Shamir's Secret Sharing System (SSSS)

   [[https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0039.md][Satoshi Lab's (Trezor) SLIP-39]] uses SSSS to distribute the ability to recover the key to 1 or more "groups".

   First, the key material is split between 1 or more groups, and a "group_threshold" of how many
   groups must bet successfully collected to recover the key.

   For example, you might have First, Second, Fam and Frens groups, and decide that any 2 groups can
   be combined to recover the key.  Each group has members with varying levels of trust, so have
   different number of Members, and differing numbers Required to recover that group's data:

   | Group  | Required | Members | Description                   |
   |--------+----------+---------+-------------------------------|
   | First  |        1 |       1 | Stored at home                |
   | Second |        1 |       1 | Stored in office safe         |
   | Fam    |        2 |       4 | Distributed to family members |
   | Frens  |        3 |       6 | Distributed to close friends  |

   The account owner might store their First and Second group data in their home and office safes.
   These are 1/1 groups (1 required, and only 1 member, so each of these are3 1-card groups.)
   #+CAPTION: SLIP-39 PDF

   [[./images/slip39-pdf.jpg]]

   If the account needs to be recovered, collecting the First and Second cards from the home and
   office safe is sufficient to recover the seed, and re-generate the HD Wallet accounts.

   Only 2 Fam member's cards must be collected to recover the Fam group's data.  So, if the HD
   Wallet owner loses their home and First group card in a fire, they could get the Second group
   card from the office safe, and 2 cards from Fam group members, and recover the wallet.

   If catastrophe strikes and the owner dies, and the heirs don't have access to either the First
   (at home) or Second (at the office), they can collect 2 Fam cards and 3 Frens cards (eg. at the
   funeral?), completing the Fam and Frens groups' data, and recover the HD Wallet account.

  [[./images/slip39-text.jpg]]

  Generating a new SLIP-39 encoded Ethereum wallet is easy, with results available as PDF or text.
  The default groups are as described above.  Run the following to obtain a PDF file similar to this
  example, insert a USB drive to collect the output, and run:

#+LATEX: {\scriptsize
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ cd /Volumes/USBDRIVE/
$ python3 -m pip install slip39
$ python3 -m slip39 Perry # or just "slip39 Perry"
...Output SLIP-39-encoded wallet for 'Perry' to:\
  Perry-2021-12-22+15.45.36-0x3868015D2894bD916262AE2EFFe913c788e81964.pdf
#+END_EXAMPLE
#+LATEX: }

  The resultant PDF will be output into the designated file.

  This PDF file can be printed on 3x5 cards, or on regular paper or card stock and the cards can be cut out.

  To get the data printed on the terminal as in this example (so you could write it down on cards
  instead), add a =-v=.

* Dependencies

  Internally, python-slip39 project uses Trezor's [[https://gihub.com/trezor/python-shamir-mnemonic.git][python-shamir-mnemonic]] to encode the seed data,
  and the Ethereum project's [[https://github.com/ethereum/eth-account][eth-account]] to convert seeds to Ethereum accounts.

** The =python-shamir-mnemonic= API

   To use it directly, obtain , and install it, or run =python3 -m pip install
shamir-mnemonic=.

** The =eth-account= API

  To creete Ethereum accounts from seed data, two steps are required.

  First, derive a Private Key from the seed data plus a derivation path:

#+LATEX: {\scriptsize
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
>>> seed=codecs.decode("dd0e2f02b1f6c92a1a265561bc164135", 'hex_codec')
>>> key=eth_account.hdaccount.key_from_seed(seed, "m/44'/60'/0'/0/0")
>>> keyhex=codecs.encode(key, 'hex_codec')
>>> keyhex
b'178870009416174c9697777b1d94229504e83f25b1605e7bb132aa5b88da64b6'
#+END_EXAMPLE
#+LATEX: }

  Then, use the private key to obtain the Ethereum account data:

#+LATEX: {\scriptsize
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
>>> keyhex.decode('ascii')
'178870009416174c9697777b1d94229504e83f25b1605e7bb132aa5b88da64b6'
>>> keyhex = '0x'+keyhex.decode('ascii')
>>> keyhex
'0x178870009416174c9697777b1d94229504e83f25b1605e7bb132aa5b88da64b6'
>>> account = eth_account.Account.from_key(keyhex)
>>> account
<eth_account.signers.local.LocalAccount object at 0x7fba368ae670>
>>> account.address
'0x336cBeAB83aCCdb2541e43D514B62DC6C53675f4'

#+LATEX: }

* Conversion from BIP-39 to SLIP-39

  If we already have a BIP-39 wallet, it would certainly be nice to be able to create nice, safe
  SLIP-39 mnemonics for it, and discard the unsafe BIP-39 mnemonics we have lying around, just
  waiting to be accidentally discovered and the account compromised!

** BIP-39 vs. SLIP-39 Incompatibility

   Unforunately, it is *not possible* to convert a BIP-39 derived wallet into a SLIP-39 wallet.
   Both of these techniques preserve "entropy" (random) bits, but these bits are used *differently*
   -- and incompatibly -- to derive the resultant Ethereum wallets.

*** BIP-39 Entropy to Mnemonic

    BIP-39 uses a single set of 12, 15, 18, 21 or 24 BIP-39 words to carefully preserve a specific
    128 to 256 bits of initial entropy.

    | Input                     | Output                        | Description                      |
    |---------------------------+-------------------------------+----------------------------------|
    | 0xA745..67                | "adult" "cattle" ... "remind" | 128 bits of entropy --> 12 words |
    | "adult cattle ... remind" | 0x9CE8...44                   | Normalized string Extended       |

    # bip39 = eth_account.hdaccount.generate_mnemonic( 12, "english" )
    bip39_english = Mnemonic("english")
    entropy = b'\xFF' * 16
    entropy_mnemonic = bip39_english.to_mnemonic( entropy )

    #+LATEX: }

    Each word is one of a corpus of 2048 words; therefore, each word encodes 11 bits (2048 == 2**11)
    of entropy.  So, we provided 128 bits, but 12*11 == 132.  So where does the extra 4 bits of data
    come from?  

    It comes from the first few bits of a SHA256 hash of the entropy, which is added to the end of
    the supplied 128 bits, to reach the required 132 bits: 132 / 11 == 12 words.

    This last 4 bits (up to 8 bits, for a 256-bit 24-word BIP-39) is checked, when validating the
    BIP-39 mnemonic.  Therefore, making up a random BIP-39 mnemonic will succeed only 1 / 16 times on
    average, due to an incorrect checksum 4-bit (16 == 2**4) .  Lets check:

    #+LATEX: {\scriptsize
    #+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :exports both :results raw drawer
    import random
    def random_words( n, count=100 ):
        for _ in range( count ):
            yield ' '.join( random.choice( bip39_english.wordlist ) for _ in range( n ))

    successes = sum(
        bip39_english.is_mnemonic_valid( m )
        for i,m in enumerate( random_words( 12, 10000 ))) / 100
    [[ f"Valid random 12-word mnemonics:" ]] + [
     [ f"{successes}%" ]] + [
     [ f"~ 1/{100/successes:.3}" ]]

    #+END_SRC

    #+RESULTS:
    :results:
    # Out[102]:
    | 0                               |
    |---------------------------------|
    | Valid random 12-word mnemonics: |
    | 6.37%                           |
    | ~ 1/15.7                        |
    :end:

    #+LATEX: }

    Sure enough, about 1/16 random 12-word phrases are valid BIP-39 mnemonics.  OK, we've got the
    contents of the BIP-39 phrase dialed in.  How is it used to generate accounts?

*** BIP-39 Mnemonic to Seed

    Unfortunately, we do *not* use the carefully preserved 128-bit entropy to generate the wallet!
    Nope, it is stretched to a 512-bit seed using PBKDF2 HMAC SAH512.  The normalized *text* of the
    12-word mnemonic is then used (with a salt of "mnemonic" plus an optional passphrase, "" by
    default), to obtain the seed:

    #+LATEX: {\scriptsize
    #+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :exports both :results raw drawer
    import codecs
    seed = bip39_english.to_seed( entropy_mnemonic )
    seedhex = codecs.encode( seed, 'hex_codec' ).decode( 'ascii' )
    [
        [ f"{len(seed)*8}-bit seed:" ]
    ] + [
        [ f"{seedhex[b*32:b*32+32]}" ]
     for b in range( len( seedhex ) // 32 )
    ]
    #+END_SRC

    #+RESULTS:
    :results:
    # Out[125]:
    | 0                                |

    | 512-bit seed:                    |
    | b6a6d8921942dd9806607ebc2750416b |

    | 577812ee449ccc448eb45e6f544e25b6 |
    :end:

    #+LATEX: }

    Then, this 512-bit seed is used to derive HD wallets.  The HD Wallet key derivation process
    consumes whatever seed entropy is provided (512 bits in this case), and uses HMAC SAH512 with a
    prefix of b"Bitcoin seed" to stretch the supplied seed entropy to 64 bytes (512 bits).  Then,
    the HD Wallet path segments are iterated through, permuting the first 32 bytes of this material
    as the key with the second 32 bytes of material as the chain node, until finally the 32-byte
    (256-bit) Ethereum account private key is produced.  We then use this private key to compute the
    rest of the Ethereum account details, such as its public address.

    #+LATEX: {\scriptsize
    #+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :exports both :results raw drawer
    path = "m/66'/40'/0'/0/0"
    key = eth_account.hdaccount.key_from_seed( seed, path )
    keyhex = '0x' + codecs.encode( key, 'hex_codec' ).decode( 'ascii' )
    eth = eth_account.Account.from_key( keyhex )

    Since there is some randomess in the SLIP-39 mnemonics generation process, we'll get a different
    set of words each time for the fixed "entropy" =0xFFFF..FF= used in this example, but we'll

*** SLIP-39 Mnemonic to Seed

    Lets prove that we can actually recover the *original* entropy from the SLIP-39 recovery
    mnemonics; in this case, we've specified a SLIP-39 group_threshold of 2 groups, so we'll use all
    1 mnemonic from Mine, and 2 from Fam:

    #+LATEX: {\scriptsize
    #+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :exports both :results raw drawer
    _,mnem_mine = entropy_slip39['Mine']

    And we'll use the same style of code as for the BIP-39 example above, to derive the Ethereum
    address from this 128-bit seed:

    #+LATEX: {\scriptsize
    #+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :exports both :results raw drawer
    reckey = eth_account.hdaccount.key_from_seed( rec, path )
    reckeyhex = '0x' + codecs.encode( reckey, 'hex_codec' ).decode( 'ascii' )
    receth = eth_account.Account.from_key( reckeyhex )
    [
        [ f"{len(reckey)*8}-bit derived key at path {path!r}:" ]
    ] + [
        [ f"{reckeyhex}" ]
    ] + [
        [ "... yields ..." ]
    ] + [
        [ f"Ethereum address: {receth.address}" ]
    ]
    #+END_SRC

    #+RESULTS:
    :results:
    # Out[39]:

    |--------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | 256-bit derived key at path "m/66'/40'/0'/0/0":                    |
    | 0x738fc6d8dd28f75027ec04b1c64cead968bbae0d9b15de2dab664e5b59db04f3 |
    | ... yields ...                                                     |
    | Ethereum address: 0x322408FCF0dAB471570038DEA08536780aAB56c5       |
    :end:

    #+LATEX: }

    And we see that we obtain the same Ethereum address =0x3224..56c5= as we originally got from =slip39.create
    above.

** BIP-39 vs SLIP-39 Key Derivation Summary

   At no time in BIP-39 account derivation is the original 128-bit mnemonic entropy used directly in
   the derivation of the wallet key.  This differs from SLIP-39, which directly uses the 128-bit mnemonic
   entropy recovered from the SLIP-39 Shamir's Secret Sharing System recovery process to generate
   each HD Wallet account's private key.

   Furthermore, there is no point in the BIP-39 entropy to account generation where we *could*
   introduce a known 128-bit seed and produce a known Ethereum wallet from it, other than as the
   very beginning.

   Therefore, SLIP-39 and BIP-39 HD Wallet generation are fundamentally distinct; we cannot produce
   BIP-39 and SLIP-39 mnemonics that result in the same wallet.  To convert your funds from a BIP-39
   wallet to a SLIP-39 wallet will require *moving* the funds.
