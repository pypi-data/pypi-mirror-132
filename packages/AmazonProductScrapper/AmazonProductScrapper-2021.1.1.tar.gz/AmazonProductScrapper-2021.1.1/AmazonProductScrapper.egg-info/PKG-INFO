**PyPi Url** : [https://pypi.org/project/AmazonProductScrapper/](https://pypi.org/project/AmazonProductScrapper/ "https://pypi.org/project/AmazonProductScrapper/")

This package helps to extract product data for all the available products from a given keyword(E.g.: laptops, headphones etc.) This data is returned in the form of  a pandas dataframe.

The package can be loaded as:

```py
import AmazonProductScrapper as aps
```

Extract product data of all laptops which are available in realtime:

```py
df = aps.load_Amazon_product_data(“laptops”)
```

df is a Pandas Dataframe. We can view the dataframe as:

```py
print(df)
```
The maximum number of pages that can be loaded for a partcular keyword is 20 and that is the final limit.

The extracted pandas Dataframe contains the data about individual products:

1. ***Product_Name** (Product Name)*

2. ***Product_Price** (Price shown for the product)*

3. ***Actual_Product_Price** (Undiscounted Price)*

4. ***Product_Rating(5)** (Product Rating)*

5. ***No._of_ratings** (Total number of ratings given by customers)*

6. ***Link** (Link of the respective product page)*

For extraction of reviews for a particular product, take the url of the product and no of pages of reviews you want to fetch. Each page contains 10 reviews approximately and the max pages that can be fetched is 500.

```py
df = aps.load_Amazon_product_review_data(“https://www.amazon.in/Boat-BassHeads-900-Wired-Headphone/dp/B074ZF7PVZ/ref=sr_1_3?crid=UPDZLG5ER2D3&keywords=headphones&qid=1640276178&sprefix=headphone%2Caps%2C647&sr=8-3”,500)
```

Provide 2 arguments to the function above, one is the url of the product and another is the number of pages to be loaded whose value has to be within 1 to 500.

```py
print(df)
```
