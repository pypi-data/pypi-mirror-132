Description: # Official docs for FastBay.
        
        # Installation
        To use **FastBay**, first install it using pip:
        ```
        pip install fastbay
        ```
        
        # Usage
        Firstly you need to import FastBay to your project. To do so, use:
        ```
        from fastbay import fbay
        ```
        
        #
        **NOTE** 
        
        Please be careful as sometimes you will need to provide the whole name of a torrent.
        
        *Example:*
        
        **WRONG**: charlie and the choco
        
        **RIGHT**: charlie and the chocolate factory
        
        #
        Let's see how to get a torrent title.
        ```
        from fastbay import fbay
        
        fbay = fbay('poirot')
        print(fbay.title())
        ```
        As you can see here, we are firstly importing fastbay and after that on line 3, we are providing the name of the torrent.
        
        #
        Now let's have a look on how to get the download link for our torrent.
        ```
        from fastbay import fbay
        
        fbay = fbay('poirot')
        print(fbay.link())
        ```
        
        #
        Final step is to get some info about the file we are going to download. To get that, we will use:
        ```
        from fastbay import fbay
        
        fbay = fbay('poirot')
        print(fbay.info())
        ```
        
        #
        # Now let's get this all by simply using:
        ```
        from fastbay import fbay
        
        fbay = fbay('poirot')
        print(fbay.title())
        print(fbay.link())
        print(fbay.info())
        ```
