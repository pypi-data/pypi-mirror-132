This package is a program that filters text based on an input.

A class named TextFilter has a function, self.findclosest(place).

place should be the string "first" or "any". Then, if place is first,
TextFilter will check every item in the "this" list (when initialised)
and if the input matches, then it will be part of what is returned.

"any" is an idiom for "return this item if TextFilter can find an 
instance of the substring 'input' inside the item of the list".
