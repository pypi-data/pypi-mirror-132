        ## Installation
        
        Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install Dbias.
        
        ```bash
        pip install Dbias
        pip install https://huggingface.co/d4data/en_pipeline/resolve/main/en_pipeline-any-py3-none-any.whl
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        ```python
        from Dbias.text_debiasing import * 
        
        # returns unbiased recommendations for a given sentence fragment.
        run("Nevertheless, Trump and other Republicans have tarred the protests as havens for terrorists intent on destroying property.")
        ```
        
        ## About
        This is a collective pipeline comprises of 3 Transformer models to de-bias/reduce amount of bias in news articles. The three models are:
        - An English sequence classification model, trained on MBAD Dataset to detect bias and fairness in sentences (news articles). This model was built on top of distilbert-base-uncased model and trained for 30 epochs with a batch size of 16, a learning rate of 5e-5, and a maximum sequence length of 512.
        - An Entity Recognition model, which is is trained on MBAD Dataset to recognize the biased word/phrases in a sentence. This model was built on top of roberta-base offered by Spacy transformers.
        - A Masked Language model, which is a Pretrained model on English language using a masked language modeling (MLM) objective.
