Description: This module is an implementation of archiver for a7d8473 archive format.
        It can archive directories, files, soft links, has shell interface.
        ## What is a7d8473?
        A7d8473 or simply a7d is a simple archive format, that has some nice features:
        * If source directory has only text files, then archive will also be text file.
        * Changing one line in the source file results in changing only one line in the archive.
        * If all source files have line lenght limit, then archive will also have line lenght limit.
        * Archived files are stored in compressor-friendly way:
          all the contents of the source file are usually included in the final archive file unchanged.
        * Metadata is saved in git-like manner. Thus only this metadata is saved:
          * Executable flag.
          * Link flag.
        * There is a bijection between the set of archive files and the set of directory structures.
        
        ## Hello world
        This is "Hello, world!" file pushed into a7d8473 archive.
        ```
        a7d8473
        :hello.txt/
        Hello, world!
        ~ ~ ~
        ```
        Here is a little more complex archive:
        ```
        a7d8473
        /name_of_directory/
        :name_of_file.txt/
        -> here is the content of file <-
        ~ ~ ~
        !name_of_another_file_that_is_executable.py/
        print('Hi')
        ~ ~ ~
        @name_of_soft_link/
        target_of_this_soft_link
        ~ ~ ~
        @link_to_Hi.py/
        ./name_of_another_file_that_is_executable.py
        ~ ~ ~
        /empty_directory/
        \
        \
        ```
        The first line of archive file is always "a7d8473".
        Other lines describe archived files and directories.
        `:` before `hello.txt` means, that file `hello.txt` is neither executable nor soft link.
        There are other prefixes of file names:
        * `@` denotes soft links.
        * `!` denotes executable files.
        * `/` denotes directories.
        * `:` denotes simple files, which are neither executable nor soft links.
        
        `/` is also used as the end of the name because it is not a valid character in file names.
        `\` means end of directory, while `~ ~ ~` denotes end of file content.
        Only printable ASCII characters are used outside of file contents.
        Thus, archive files are text files as long as source files are text files.
