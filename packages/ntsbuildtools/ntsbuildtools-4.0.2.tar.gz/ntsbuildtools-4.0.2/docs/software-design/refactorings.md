Refactors that are in-progress or should be done:

1. Use the default version of mistletoe and python's builtin `deepcopy` function.
2. Refactor the 'markdown fragmentation' logic into its own, independent package.
3. Support downloading ntsbuildtools as a wheel
4. Provide a 'show docs' subcommand, to see the docs for the currently installed buildtools version.
