# Qcover 
Qcover is an open source effort to help exploring combinatorial optimization problems in Noisy Intermediate-scale Quantum(NISQ) processor. It is developed by the quantum operating system team in Beijing Academy of Quantum Information Sciences (BAQIS). Qcover supports fast output of optimal parameters in shallow QAOA circuits. It can be used as a powerful tool to assist NISQ processor to demonstrate application-level quantum advantages. 

# Getting started
Using the following commands to build the executable environment of Qcover
```git
conda install --yes --file requirements.txt
```
To start using Qcover, simply run
```git
pip install Qcover
```
or
```git
git clone https://github.com/BAQIS-Quantum/Qcover
python setup.py install
```
More example codes and tutorials can be found in the tests folder here on GitHub.

# Examples
1. Using algorithm core module to generate the ising random weighted graph and calculate it's Hamiltonian expectation
    ```python
    from core import Qcover
    from backends import CircuitByQulacs
    from optimizers import COBYLA
    
    node_num, edge_num = 6, 9
    p = 1
    nodes, edges = Qcover.generate_graph_data(node_num, edge_num)
    g = Qcover.generate_weighted_graph(nodes, edges)
    qulacs_bc = CircuitByQulacs()
    optc = COBYLA(maxiter=30, tol=1e-6, disp=True)
    qc = Qcover(g, p=p, optimizer=optc, backend=qulacs_bc)
    res = qc.run()
    print("the result of problem is:\n", res)
    qc.backend.visualization()
    ```
2. Solving specific binary combinatorial optimization problems, Calculating the expectation value of the Hamiltonian of the circuit which corresponding to the problem.
for example, if you want to using Qcover to solve a max-cut problem, just coding below:
    ```python
    import numpy as np
    from core import Qcover
    from backends import CircuitByQiskit
    from optimizers import COBYLA
    from applications.max_cut import MaxCut
    node_num, degree = 6, 3
    p = 1
    mxt = MaxCut(node_num=node_num, node_degree=degree)
    ising_g = mxt.run()
    qiskit_bc = CircuitByQiskit(expectation_calc_method="statevector")
    optc = COBYLA(maxiter=30, tol=1e-6, disp=True, initial_point=np.asarray([0.5, 0.5]))
    qc = Qcover(ising_g, p=p, optimizer=optc, backend=qiskit_bc)
    res = qc.run()
    print("the result of problem is:\n", res)
    qc.backend.visualization()
    ```
