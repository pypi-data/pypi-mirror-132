Description: # ruddocom.pdfiframer: correct handling of PDFs in IFRAMEs
        
        This Plone add-on adds a bit of JavaScript that turns all served `IFRAME`s
        which embed a PDF into a clickable icon the user must tap or click before
        the PDF is actually embedded and rendered.
        
        This not only saves you bandwidth, it also prevents a nasty behavior on
        mobile devices when embedding PDFs using `IFRAME`s â€” instead of the PDF
        being displayed, a download window pops up (yes, even when the server sends
        a `Content-Disposition: inline` HTTP header).
         
        Thus, visitors to your site can see the PDF onscreen with one click, and
        mobile visitors can download the PDF by clicking / tapping on the icon.
        
        Note that, by default, Plone filters `IFRAME` tags out of content types.
        Use the HTML filtering control panel configuration screen to allow `IFRAME`s
        to be used on your Plone site.
        
        
        ## Setup
        
        It's a standard Plone add-on.  Add to your Plone eggs list, buildout.
