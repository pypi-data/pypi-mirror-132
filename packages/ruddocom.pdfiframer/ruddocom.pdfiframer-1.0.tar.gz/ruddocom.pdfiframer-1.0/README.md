# ruddocom.pdfiframer: correct handling of PDFs in IFRAMEs

This Plone add-on adds a bit of JavaScript that turns all served `IFRAME`s
which embed a PDF into a clickable icon the user must tap or click before
the PDF is actually embedded and rendered.

This not only saves you bandwidth, it also prevents a nasty behavior on
mobile devices when embedding PDFs using `IFRAME`s â€” instead of the PDF
being displayed, a download window pops up (yes, even when the server sends
a `Content-Disposition: inline` HTTP header).
 
Thus, visitors to your site can see the PDF onscreen with one click, and
mobile visitors can download the PDF by clicking / tapping on the icon.

Note that, by default, Plone filters `IFRAME` tags out of content types.
Use the HTML filtering control panel configuration screen to allow `IFRAME`s
to be used on your Plone site.
