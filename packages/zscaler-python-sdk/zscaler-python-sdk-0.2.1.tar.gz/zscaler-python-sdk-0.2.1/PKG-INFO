# Zscaler Python SDK
This is a Python SDK for Zscaler Internet Access. This client library is designed to support the Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) API. Now This library does not support Zscaler Private Access (ZPA), but this will be implemented in the future.
This SDK has been developed mainly using Python 3.9.0 .

NOTE: This repository is not official. Zscaler does not support this repository.

## Preparation
You need a ZIA credentials like below.
- ZIA Admin Username (like `admin@example.com`)
- ZIA Admin Password
- ZIA Hostname (like `zscaler.net`)
- ZIA APIKEY (You need to request an api key to Zscaler support team.)

If you have verified your credentials, set up your credentials to use this repository. Please replace `/Users/utah18` to your arbitrary directory path.

```
$ mkdir /Users/utah18/.zscaler && cat > /Users/utah18/.zscaler/config.ini <<EOF
[zia]
USERNAME=example@example.com
PASSWORD=P@ssw0rd
HOSTNAME=zscaler.net
APIKEY=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
EOF
```

## Clone and Install Repository
In this case, we use `poetry`. If you don't have this, please install poetry from [HERE](https://python-poetry.org/docs/)
```
$ poetry add zscaler-python-sdk
```
