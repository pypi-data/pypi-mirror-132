  Pyfood is a simple Python package to process food, in different languages. Pyfood's ambition is to be the go-to library to deal with food, recipes, online menus or cookbooks.
</p>

## Installation 

Pyfood is intended to work with **Python 3.6 or above**. Installation can be done with `pip`:

```sh
pip install pyfood
```

## Quickstart

At the core of Pyfood is the concept of a ``shelf`` embedded in a given ``region``, a certain ``month_id`` and optionally a ``source`` language.
You can load a shelf embedded in France in January with the following Python snippet:

```python
from pyfood.utils import Shelf
shelf = Shelf(region='France', month_id=0)
```

Pyfood works in the following region by default ``EU`` (**Europe**), which includes ``France``, ``Germany``, ``Italy``, ``Portugal``, ``Spain``, ``United Kingdom``. Support for ``Canada``, ``Israel``, ``Japan`` and ``Senegal`` is also provided

### üçê Label baskets or recipes

In a few lines of code, Pyfood can help automatically **extract, translate, label** a list of ingredients, e.g., from a basket of food, [a recipe](https://www.local-seasonal.org/chefs/Binet%20Soup/cookbook?name=Gazpacho), a menu, [a cookbook](https://www.local-seasonal.org/chefs/Binet%20Soup/cookbook) or a webapp, with multiple labels, e.g., vegetarian, vegan, nutrition and seasonality:

```python
results = shelf.process_ingredients(['apple','kiwi','sugar'])
results['labels'] # vegetarian, vegan, nutrition, seasonality
```

### üçã Translate ingredients
Pyfood comes with a vocabulary of more than 600 ingredients and synonymes, in multiple languages, and makes it easy to work with recipes in different languages or translate ingredients from a language to another one:

```python
results = shelf.process_ingredients(['apple','kiwi','sugar'], lang_dest='FR')
results['ingredients_by_taxon'] # [[pomme, kiwi], [sucre]]
```

Pyfood supports the following language by default ``UN`` (**Universal**), which includes ``DE`` (German), ``EN`` (English), ``ES`` (Spanish). ``FR`` (French), ``IT`` (Italian), ``PT`` (Portuguese)

### üçì What's in season?

Finally, Pyfood can also be used to simply query what [fruits](https://www.local-seasonal.org/en/on-the-menu?name=Fruits) or [vegetables](https://www.local-seasonal.org/en/on-the-menu?name=Vegetables) are in season:

```python
fruits_in_season = shelf.get_seasonal_food(key='001')
vegetables_in_season = shelf.get_seasonal_food(key='002')
```
