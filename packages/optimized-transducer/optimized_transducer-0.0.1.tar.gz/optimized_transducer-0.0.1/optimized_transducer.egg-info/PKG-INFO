Description: ## Introduction
        
        Still working in progress.
        
        This repo implements the optimization techniques proposed in
        [Improving RNN Transducer Modeling for End-to-End Speech Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.12415)
        to reduce the memory consumption for computing transducer loss,
        based on the transducer loss from [torchaudio](https://github.com/pytorch/audio).
