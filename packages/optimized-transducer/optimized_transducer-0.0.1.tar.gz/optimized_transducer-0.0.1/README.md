## Introduction

Still working in progress.

This repo implements the optimization techniques proposed in
[Improving RNN Transducer Modeling for End-to-End Speech Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.12415)
to reduce the memory consumption for computing transducer loss,
based on the transducer loss from [torchaudio](https://github.com/pytorch/audio).
