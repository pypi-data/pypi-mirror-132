# interviewer - a little bot helping you to prep your job interviews

## What it does
<code>interviewer</code> is a little python library that defines a bot to help you 
practice your interview skills. It basically prompts interview questions in your 
python console and stops the time it takes you to answer those. It is not much, 
but it definitely helped me to pick up some confidence.
