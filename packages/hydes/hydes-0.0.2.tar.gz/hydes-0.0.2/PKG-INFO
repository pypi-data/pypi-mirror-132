# HyDES
HydroDinamical Equation Solver Code to numerically solve the hydrodynamical equations in 2 dimensions in a regular rectangular mesh. The code performs a first order staggered Lax-Friedrich scheme in time and a central first order derivative in space. There are several initial conditions to test and a some boundary conditions, like 0 derivative in the boundaries or periodic ones. The code is impleted originaly in IDL in may 2019 and it will be transcripted to python.
