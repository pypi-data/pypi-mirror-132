===================================================
spec for YAML files to configure feature extraction
===================================================

This document specifies the structure of HVC config files written in YAML.

structure
---------
Every ``extract.config.yml`` file should be written in YAML as a dictionary with
(key, value) pairs.
In other words, any YAML file that contains a configuration for feature extraction
should define a dictionary named ``extract`` with keys as outlined below.

required key: ``todo_list``
---------------------------
Every ``extract.config.yml`` file has exactly one **required** key at the top level:
   ``todo_list``: list of dicts
      list where each element is a dict.
      each dict sets parameters for a 'job', typically
      data associated with one set of vocalizations.

optional keys
-------------
``extract.config.yml`` files *may* optionally define two other keys at the same level as ``todo_list``.
Those keys are ``spect_params`` and ``segment_params``. As might be expected, ``spect_params`` is a dict
that contains parameters for making spectrograms. The ``segment_params`` dict contains parameters for
segmenting song. Specifications for these dictionaries are given below.

When defined at the same level as ``todo_list`` they are considered "default" and apply to all items in the list.
If an element in `todo_list` defines different values for any of these keys,
the value assigned in that element takes precedence over the `default` value.

specification for dictionaries in ``todo_list``
-----------------------------------------------

required keys
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Every dict in a ``todo_list`` has the following **required** keys:
  * ``bird_ID`` : str
    for example, ``bl26lb16``

  * ``file_format``: str
    one of ``{'evtaf','koumura'}``

  * ``data_dirs``: list of str
    directories containing data
    each str must be a valid directory that can be found on the path
    for example

    .. code-block:: yaml

        - C:\DATA\bl26lb16\pre_surgery_baseline\041912
        - C:\DATA\bl26lb16\pre_surgery_baseline\042012

  * ``output_dir``: str
    directory in which to save output
    if it doesn't exist, HVC will create it
    for example, ``C:\DATA\bl26lb16\``

  * ``labelset``: str
    string of labels corresponding to labeled segments
    from which features should be extracted.
    Segments with labels not in this str will be ignored.
    Converted to a list but not necessary to enter as a list.
    For example, ``iabcdef``

Finally, each dict in a ``todo_list`` must define *either*
``feature_list`` *or* a ``feature_group``

   * ``feature_list`` : list
        named features. See the list of named features here:
        :doc:`named_features`

   * ``feature_group`` : str or list
        named group of features, list if more than one group
        one of ``{'knn','svm'}``

   * Note that a ``todo_list`` can define *both* a ``feature_list``
     and a ``feature_group``. In this case features from the ``feature_group``
     are added to the ``feature_list``.

Additional variables are added to the feature files that are output by
``featureextract.extract`` to keep track of which features belong to which
feature group.

specification for ``spect_params`` and ``segment_params`` dictionaries
----------------------------------------------------------------------

   * ``spect_params``: dict
      parameters to calculate spectrogram
      keys correspond to parameters/arguments passed to Spectrogram class for __init__.
      **must** have *either* a ``ref`` key *or* the ``nperseg`` and ``noverlap`` keys
      as defined below:
         ``ref`` : str
            one of ``{'tachibana','koumura'}``
            Use spectrogram parameters from a reference.
            ``'tachibana'`` uses spectrogram parameters from [1]_,
            ``'koumura'`` uses spectrogram parameters from [2]_.

         ``nperseg`` : int
            numper of samples per segment for FFT, e.g. 512
         ``noverlap`` : int
            number of overlapping samples in each segment

      the following keys are all **optional** for ``spect_params``:
        ``freq_cutoffs`` : two-element list of integers
            limits of frequency band to keep, e.g. [1000,8000]
            ``Spectrogram.make`` keeps the band:
                freq_cutoffs[0] >= spectrogram > freq_cutoffs[1]
        ``window`` : str
            window to apply to segments
            valid strings are ``'Hann', 'dpss', None``
            Hann -- Uses ``np.Hanning`` with parameter ``M`` (window width) set to value of ``nperseg``
            dpss -- Discrete prolate spheroidal sequence AKA Slepian.
                Uses ``scipy.signal.slepian`` with M parameter equal to ``nperseg`` and
                width parameter equal to ``4/nperseg``, as in [2]_.
        ``filter_func`` : str
            filter to apply to raw audio. valid strings are ``'diff'`` or ``None``
            ``'diff'`` -- differential filter, literally ``np.diff`` applied to signal as in [1]_.
            ``None`` -- no filter, this is the default
        ``spect_func`` : str
            which function to use for spectrogram.
            valid strings are 'scipy' or 'mpl'.
            ``'scipy'`` uses ``scipy.signal.spectrogram``,
            ``'mpl'`` uses ``matplotlib.matlab.specgram``.
            Default is ``'scipy'``.
        ``log_transform_spect`` : bool
            if True, applies np.log10 to spectrogram to increase range. Default is True.

   ``segment_params``: dict
      parameters for dividing audio into segments, defined below
      with the following keys
         ``threshold`` : int
            value above which amplitude is considered part of a segment. default is 5000.
         ``min_syl_dur`` : float
            minimum duration of a segment. default is 0.02, i.e. 20 ms.
         ``min_silent_dur`` : float
            minimum duration of silent gap between segment. default is 0.002, i.e. 2 ms.
