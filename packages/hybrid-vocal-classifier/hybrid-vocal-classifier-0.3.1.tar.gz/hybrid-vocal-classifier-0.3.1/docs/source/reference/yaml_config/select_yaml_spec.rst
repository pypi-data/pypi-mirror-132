================================================
spec for YAML files to configure model selection
================================================

This document specifies the structure of HVC config files written in
YAML.

structure
---------
Every ``select.config.yml`` file should be written in YAML as a dictionary with (key, value) pairs.
In other words, any YAML file that contains a configuration for model selection should define
a dictionary named ``select`` with keys as outlined below.

required key: ``todo_list``
---------------------------
Every ``select.config.yml`` file has exactly one **required** key at the top level:
  ``todo_list``: list of dicts
    list where each element is a dict.
    each dict sets parameters for a 'job', typically
    data associated with one set of vocalizations.

optional keys
-------------
``select.config.yml`` files *may* optionally define other keys at the same level as ``todo_list``.
Those keys are:
  ``num_replicates``: int
    number of replicates, i.e. number of folds for cross-validation

  ``num_test_samples``: int
    number of samples from feature file to put in testing set

  ``num_train_samples``: int
    number of samples from feature file to put in training set

  ``models``: list
    list of dictionaries that define models to be tested on features

When defined at the same level as ``todo_list`` they are considered ``default``.
If an element in ``todo_list`` defines different values for any of these keys,
the value assigned in that element takes precedence over the ``default`` value.

specification for dictionaries in todo_list
-------------------------------------------
required keys
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Every dict in a ``todo_list`` has the following **required** keys:
  * ``feature_file`` : str
    for example:
    ``C:\Data\gy6or6\extract_output_170711_0104\summary_feature_file_created_170711_0104``

  * ``output_dir``: str
    path to directory in which to save output
    if it doesn't exist, HVC will create it
    for example, ``C:\DATA\bl26lb16\``

optional keys
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
As stated above, these can all be defined at the top level of the file. If they are also defined
for any dict in a ``todo_list``, then that definition will override the top-level definition.
  * ``models``: list of dicts
     dictionary of models, as defined below.
     Required if not defined at top level of file.
  * ``num_replicates``: int
      number of replicates, i.e. number of folds for cross-validation

  * ``num_test_samples``: int
      number of samples from feature file to put in testing set

  * ``num_train_samples``: int
      number of samples from feature file to put in training set

specification for models list of dicts
--------------------------------------
Every dict in a ``models`` list has the following **required** keys:
  * ``model_name``: str
      name of model, e.g. 'svm'
  * ``hyperparameters``: dict
      with hyperparameters defined for each model

Every dict in a ``models`` list must also specify the features with which to train the model.
One of the following is valid, as specified in ``validation.yml``.
   * ``feature_list_indices``: list of ints
      corresponding to elements in list of feature names in feature_file
      e.g., ``[0,1,2,5,7]``
   * ``feature_group``: str
      name of a feature group: one of ``{'knn','svm'}``
   * ``neuralnet_input``: str
      name of input for am artificial neural net: ``{'flatwindow'}``

example ``select_config.yml``
-----------------------------

These are some of the ``select.config.yml`` files used for testing, found in
``hybrid-vocal-classifier/tests/data_for_tests/config.yml/``:

.. literalinclude:: ../..../../tests/data_for_tests/config.yml/test_select_knn_ftr_grp.config.yml

.. literalinclude:: ../..../../tests/data_for_tests/config.yml/test_select_svm.config.yml

.. literalinclude:: ../..../../tests/data_for_tests/config.yml/test_select_flatwindow.config.yml
