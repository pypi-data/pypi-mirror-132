autocompare workflow
====================

| Here's the steps in the workflow for comparing different machine learning models.  
| Bold terms are defined on the page describing this workflow in detail, linked below this list.  
| 0. Label a small set of songs to provide **training data** for the models, typically ~20 songs.
| 1. Pick the **models** you will compare.  
| 2. Extract **features** for those models from song files that will be used to **train** the model.  
| 3. Pick the **hyperparameters** for the different models. 
| 4. Fit the **models** to the data  
| 5. Select the **best** model
