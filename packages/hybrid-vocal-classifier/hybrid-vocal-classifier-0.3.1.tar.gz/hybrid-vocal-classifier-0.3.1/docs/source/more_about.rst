----------------------------------

Scientists that study how birdsong at the level of individual birds often
have to label the syllables of each bird's song by hand in order to get
results. Because birds can sing hundreds of songs a day, it requires many
person-hours to label song. In addition, in many songbird species that have been studied,
each individual learns a song that is similar but not exactly the same
as the song of the bird or birds that tutored it. Therefore any software 
that automates the process of labeling syllables
must classify them with very high accuracy and must do so in a way that
is robust across the songs of many different individuals from a species.

The primary goal of `hybrid-vocal-classifier` is to make it easier
for any scientist to apply machine-learning algorithms to birdsong.

The secondary goal of the package is to facilitate comparisons of
different machine learning algorithms. Several groups have published
on various algorithms: for a list of some of the algorithms 
used by this library, see :ref:`citations`, and see related works
in :ref:`related`. Along with the library, a large dataset containing
days of hand-labeled song was released. 
Open repositories were crucial for other advances in machine learning.
A list with links to that dataset and others can be found on the :ref:`repos` page.

A final goal is to further develop the links between 
machine learning, artificial intelligence, and the study of
birdsong. Obviously, the work most related to this library
is in automated speech recognition. Birdsong presents an
ideal test-bed to experiment with related machine
learning algorithms, e.g., for segmenting time-series data.

more about songbird science
---------------------------

Songbirds provide a model system to understand how the brain learns and produces
speech and other sequential motor skills acquired by imitation, like
playing the piano or shooting a basketball. Like babies learning to talk,
songbirds learn their song from an adult "tutor" during
a sensitive period in development . Each individual bird
has its own unique song, often very similar to the song of the bird that tutored it.
The songbird brains contain a specialized network of areas required for learning and producing song.
Although this network, known as the song system, is found only in songbird brains,
it has evolved on top of the basic floor plan that appears in all vertebrate brains, including humans.
By understanding the song system, we can understand more about our own brain.
Many other aspects of songbird behavior can tell us more about ourselves and our environment,
and by studying their vocalizations we open a window into their world.
