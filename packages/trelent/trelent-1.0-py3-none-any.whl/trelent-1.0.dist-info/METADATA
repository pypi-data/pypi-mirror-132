# Trelent CLI
Welcome to the Trelent CLI (Command Line Interface)! The Trelent CLI let's you offload documentation to us in a much more direct manner - we'll document an entire project all at once on your behalf. No more generating docstrings for individual functions!
___

## Usage
Before using the CLI, you have to authenticate it using your Trelent API Key, which can be found on our [Dashboard](https://docgen.trelent.net). Please note that use of the Trelent-CLI is a paid feature and is unavailable unless you upgrade your account to a paid tier.

Please note that the auth command stores your Trelent API Key locally in plain text. We are working on an improved solution and apologize for any inconvenience.

Authenticate to Trelent using the command below, and follow the prompts:
```bash
trelent auth
```

You may also passs your Trelent API Key directly into other commands by using the --key (-k for short) option:
```bash
trelent document -k sk_trlnt_... [FOLDER_PATH]
```

Once authenticated, you may generate documentation for all source code files in a given folder:
```bash
trelent document [FOLDER_PATH]
```

By default, docstrings will be added to a .diff file next to source. For example, a file called test.py:
```python
def add_nums(num1, num2):
    return num1 + num2
```

We generate test.py.diff:
```
  def add_nums(num1, num2):
+     """Docstring here"""
      return num1 + num2
```

If you wish to insert docstrings directly into your source files, use the --insert (-i for short) flag:
```bash
trelent document -i [FOLDER_PATH]
```

We offer verbose output if you want some insight into why functions or files were skipped. Use the --verbose (-v for short) flag:
```bash
trelent document -v [FOLDER_PATH]
```
