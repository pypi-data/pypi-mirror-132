Description: # MPOSE2021:
        #### A Dataset for Real-Time Short-Time HAR
        
        This repository contains the MPOSE2021 Dataset for short-time pose-based Human Action Recognition (HAR). 
        MPOSE2021 is specifically designed to perform short-time Human Action Recognition.
        
        MPOSE2021 is developed as an evolution of the MPOSE Dataset [1-3]. It is made by human pose data detected by 
        [OpenPose](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose) [4] (and [Posenet](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/posenet), coming soon!) 
        on popular datasets for HAR, i.e. Weizmann [5], i3DPost [6], IXMAS [7], KTH [8], UTKinetic-Action3D (RGB only) [9] and UTD-MHAD (RGB only) [10], alongside original video datasets, i.e. ISLD and ISLD-Additional-Sequences [1].
        Since these datasets have heterogenous action labels, each dataset labels are remapped to a common and homogeneous list of actions.
        
        This repository allows users to generate pose data for MPOSE2021 in a python-friendly format. 
        Generated sequences have a number of frames between 20 and 30. 
        Sequences are obtained by cutting the so-called Precursor VIDEOS (videos from the above-mentioned datasets), with non-overlapping sliding windows.
        Frames where OpenPose cannot detect any subject are automatically discarded. Resulting samples contain one subject at the time, performing a fraction of a single action. Overall, MPOSE2021 contains 15429 samples, divided into 20 actions, performed by 100 subjects. 
        
        The overview of the action composition of MPOSE2021 is provided [here](https://github.com/FedericoAngelini/MPOSE2021_Dataset/blob/master/docs/mpose2021_summary.pdf?raw=true).
        
        Below, the steps to install the ```mpose``` library and obtain sequences are explained.

        ### Installation
        
        Install MPOSE2021 as python package from [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/mpose)
        ```
        pip install mpose
        ```
        
        ### Getting Started
        
        This minimal working example
        ```python
        # import package
        import mpose
        
        # initialize and download data
        dataset = mpose.MPOSE(pose_extractor='openpose', 
                              split=1, 
                              transform='scale_and_center', 
                              data_dir='./data/')
        
        # print data info 
        dataset.get_info()
        
        # get data samples (as numpy arrays)
        X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test = dataset.get_dataset()
        ```
