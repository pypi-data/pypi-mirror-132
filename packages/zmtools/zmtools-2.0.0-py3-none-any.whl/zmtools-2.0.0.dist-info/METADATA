HEADS UP: This was the first public thing I ever wrote, and it is *trash*. I will be phasing this out and yanking it from PyPI when I get around to that.

A conglomeration of functions reused in my program; maybe they can help you too. The docstrings should explain all you need to know. This will grow as my projects multiply.
