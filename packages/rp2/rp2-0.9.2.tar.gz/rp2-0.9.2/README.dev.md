## Introduction
This document describes [RP2](https://github.com/eprbell/rp2) setup instructions, development workflow, design principles, source tree structure and plugin architecture.

## License
RP2 is released under the terms of Apache License Version 2.0. For more information see [LICENSE](LICENSE) or <http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0>.

## Download
The latest RP2 source can be downloaded at: <https://github.com/eprbell/rp2>

## Setup
RP2 has been tested on Ubuntu Linux, macOS and Windows 10 but it should work on all systems that have Python version 3.7.0 or greater. Virtualenv is recommended for RP2 development. Note that requirements.txt contains `-e .`, which installs the RP2 package in editable mode.

### Setup on Ubuntu Linux
First make sure Python, pip and virtualenv are installed. If not, open a terminal window and enter the following commands:
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip virtualenv
```

Then install RP2 Python package requirements:
```
cd <rp2_directory>
virtualenv -p python3 .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
.venv/bin/pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
### Setup on macOS
First make sure [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) is installed, then open a terminal window and enter the following commands:
```
brew update
brew install python3 virtualenv
```

Then install RP2 Python package requirements:
```
cd <rp2_directory>
virtualenv -p python3 .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
.venv/bin/pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
### Setup on Windows 10
First make sure [Python](https://python.org) 3.7 or greater is installed (in the Python installer window be sure to click on "Add Python to PATH"), then open a PowerShell window and enter the following commands:
```
python -m pip install virtualenv
```

Then install RP2 Python package requirements:
```
cd <rp2_directory>
virtualenv -p python .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate.ps1
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Setup on Other Unix-like Systems
* install python 3.7 or greater
* install pip3
* install virtualenv
* cd _<rp2_directory>_
* `virtualenv -p python3 .venv`
* `.venv/bin/pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

## Source Code
The RP2 source tree is organized as follows:
* `.bumpversion.cfg`: bumpversion configuration;
* `CHANGELOG.md`: change log document;
* `config/`: config files for examples and tests;
* `CONTRIBUTING.md`: contribution guidelines;
* `docs/`: additional documentation, referenced from the README files;
* `.editorconfig`;
* `.github/workflows/`: configuration of Github continuous integration;
* `.gitignore`;
* `input/`: examples and tests;
* `input/golden/`: expected outputs that RP2 tests compare against;
* `.isort.cfg`: isort configuration;
* `LICENSE`: license information;
* `Makefile`: obsolete, will be deleted in the future;
* `MANIFEST.in`: source distribution configuration;
* `mypy.ini`: Mypy configuration;
* `.pre-commit-config.yaml`: pre-commit configuration;
* `.pylintrc`: Pylint configuration;
* `pyproject.toml`: packaging configuration;
* `README.dev.md`: developer documentation;
* `README.md`: user documentation;
* `requirements.txt`: Python dependency file for development;
* `setup.cfg`: static packaging configuration file;
* `setup.py`: dynamic packaging configuration file;
* `src/rp2`: RP2 code, including classes for transactions, gains, tax engine, balances, logger, ODS parser, etc.;
* `src/rp2/plugin/report/`: report generator plugins;
* `src/rp2/plugin/report/data/`: spreadsheet templates that are used by the builtin report plugins;
* `src/stubs/`: RP2 relies on the pyexcel-ezodf library, which doesn't have typing information, so it is added here;
* `tests/`: unit tests.

## Development
Read the [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) document on pull requests guidelines.

### Design Guidelines
RP2 code adheres to these principles:
* immutability: all data structures are read-only.
  * class fields are private (prepended with double-underscore). Fields that need public access have a read-only property. Write-properties are never used;
  * @dataclass classes have `frozen=True`
* runtime checks: parameters of public functions are type-checked at runtime:
  * `Configuration.type_check_*()` for primitive types;
  * `<class>.type_check()` for classes;
* type hints: all variables and functions have Python type hints;
* no id-based hashing: classes that are added to dictionaries and sets redefine `__eq__()`, `__neq__()` and `__hash__()`;
* encapsulated math: all high-precision math is done via `RP2Decimal` (a subclass of Decimal), to ensure the correct precision is used throughout the code. `RP2Decimal` instances are never mixed with other types in expressions;
* f-strings only: every time string interpolation is needed, f-strings are used;
* logging: logging is done via `logger.LOGGER`;
* no unnamed tuples: dataclasses or named tuples are used instead;
* no imports with `*`.

### Development Workflow
RP2 uses pre-commit hooks for quick validation at commit time and continuous integration via Github actions for deeper testing. Pre-commit hooks invoke: flake8, black, isort, pyupgrade and more. Github actions invoke: mypy, pylint, bandit, unit tests (on Linux, Mac and Windows), markdown link check and more.

While every commit and push are automatically tested as described, sometimes it's useful to run some of the above commands locally without waiting for continuous integration. Here's how to run the most common ones:
* run unit tests: `pytest --tb=native --verbose`
* type check: `mypy src tests`
* lint: `pylint -r y src tests`
* security check: `bandit -r src`
* reformat code: `black src tests`
* sort imports: `isort .`
* run pre-commit tests without committing: `pre-commit run --all-files`

Logs are stored in the `log` directory. To generate debug logs, prepend the command line with `LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG`, e.g.:
```
LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG bin/rp2.py -o output -p crypto_example_ config/crypto_example.config input/crypto_example.ods
```

### Unit Tests
RP2 has considerable unit test coverage to reduce the risk of regression. Unit tests are in the [tests](tests) directory. Please add unit tests for any new code.

## Plugin Development
RP2 has a plugin architecture for report generators, which makes it extensible for new use cases. Writing a new plugin is quite easy: the [tax_report_us](src/rp2/plugin/report/tax_report_us.py) generator is a simple example, the [rp2_full_report](src/rp2/plugin/report/rp2_full_report.py) one is more comprehensive.

Plugins are discovered by RP2 at runtime and they must adhere to the conventions shown below. To add a new plugin follow this procedure:
* add a new Python file in the src/rp2/plugin/report directory and give it a meaningful name
* import the following (plus any other RP2 file you might need):
```
from abstract_report_generator import AbstractReportGenerator
from computed_data import ComputedData
from gain_loss import GainLoss
from gain_loss_set import GainLossSet
```
* Optionally, RP2 provides a logger facility:
```
from logger import LOGGER
```
* Add a class named `Generator`, deriving from `AbstractReportGenerator`:
```
class Generator(AbstractReportGenerator):
```
* Add a `generate()` method with the following signature:
```
    def generate(
        self,
        asset_to_computed_data: Dict[str, ComputedData],
        output_dir_path: str,
        output_file_prefix: str,
    ) -> None:
```
* write the body of the method. The parameters are:
  * `asset_to_computed_data`: dictionary mapping user asset (i.e. cryptocurrency) to the computed tax data for that asset. For each user asset there is one instance of [ComputedData](src/rp2/computed_data.py);
  * `output_dir_path`: directory in which to write the output;
  * `output_file_prefix`: prefix to be prepended to the output file name.
