Description: Python code to partly mimic the functionality of the Conquest Pacs system ( http://www.natura-ingenium.nl/dicom.html ).
        Done by reverse engineering ( not using the source code of conquest ).
        
        a/ indexer properties : read a dicom tree and build a sqlite database from this which conforms to the Conquest standard.
        b/ use the conquest style dicom.sql to define the columns
        c/ provide low level procedures to write and read to the database
        d/ provide basic SCU and SCP functionality
        
        No attempt made to mimic
        full dicom functionality
        lua scripting
        image representation
