Description: ### Dienen
        Build complex deep learning models using configuration files.
        
        ##### Installation
        First of all you need to have tensorflow with gpu working in your system. You should be able to run nvidia-smi and get information about your GPUs.
        
        Then, install using pip
        
        ```
        pip install dienen
        ```
        
        Now, that dienen is installed, it is time to train some models. Check out the [tutorial](docs/tutorial.md) and learn how to do it.
